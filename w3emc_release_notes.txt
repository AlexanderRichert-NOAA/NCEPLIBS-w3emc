  History of updates and changes to w3emc library.

Modification history

---

  The w3emc library was created by the splitting of the production w3lib into 
separate w3nco and w3emc libraries (c. 27 Dec 2012).

  As of the first authoring of these release notes (c. April 2014) the version 
of the w3emc library in use in production was v2.0.5.

---- History of Releases:

*** w3emc_v2.0.5 --> released c. 16 Apr 2013
 In production use thru April 2014.

*** w3emc_v2.1.0 --> tagged 06 May 2013
 Never separately implemented into production. The changes for this library tag
 were mostly build-procedure related.
 
 Build procedure changes.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #16, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/16
 * All source code was moved into the /libsrc directory.
 * An Autoconf configuration script, configure, was created.
 * A generic build script, make_w3emc_lib.sh, was created to build the three different
   precisions of the w3emc library.
 * A set of "standard" environment variable setup files were created and placed in the
   config-setup directory.
 * A README file for the new build procedure was created.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #56, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/56
 * Corrected a problem with if-block syntax in the "configure.ac" script.
 * Updated the gfortran compiler setup files to prevent integer overflow compile errors.
 
 Code changes.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #36, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/36
 * Removed "C$" comment characters from affected w3emc code as these are the sentinel
   characters for fixed source form conditional compilation in OpenMP.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #50, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/50
 * Modified the "start.f" source code to allow preprocessing so the correct 
   subroutine name is used for non-AIX systems (not really an issue now the CCS 
   has been retired.)
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #51, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/51
 * This updated the nceplibs repository copy of "gblevents.f" to be brought up to date
   with an implementation by NCO via the ObsProc group.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #56, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/56
 * Defined the iargc() function as an external in "args_mod.f" to prevent recursive
   call compile errors when gfortran is used.
 

*** w3emc_v2.2.0 --> released c. Apr 2014
 Implemented into production c. April 2014, in support of prepobs_prepdata release v3.0.0

 Build procedure changes.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #68, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/68
 * The build procedure was updated to use both the new vertical structure for the
   library implementations as well as use the module-load-defined environment
   variables, SIGIO_INC4 and SIGIO_LIB4, for the location of the dependent sigio
   include files and static library. 
 
 Code changes.
 4 April 2014  DKeyser  Updated gblevents
   * Only attempt PMSL derivation for surface reports.
   * Store pmsl ob/qm and pmin in a 1-dim array rather than a 2-dim array 
     since only 1 level (surface report) is processed.
   * Suppress printout of reports where pmsl is derived.
   * Add requirement that exactly 1 level was updated with derived pmsl in 
     order to write out new derived pmsl "pseudo-event".
